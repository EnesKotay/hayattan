## Vercel Web Analytics Integration for Next.js

### Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Installed Dependencies
- **@vercel/analytics@^1.6.1** - Vercel Web Analytics package for Next.js
- **@tiptap/core@^3.19.0** - Added missing peer dependency for existing TipTap editor components

#### 2. Modified Files

**src/app/layout.tsx**
- Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Added `<Analytics />` component at the end of the `<body>` tag, after all provider wrappers
- Placement ensures analytics tracks all page interactions while maintaining existing component hierarchy

**package.json**
- Added `@vercel/analytics` to dependencies
- Added `@tiptap/core` to dependencies (resolved pre-existing missing peer dependency)

**pnpm-lock.yaml**
- Updated lockfile to reflect new dependencies
- Ensures consistent dependency resolution across environments

**next-env.d.ts**
- Auto-generated Next.js TypeScript definitions updated

### Implementation Details

The Analytics component was strategically placed:
- Inside the `<body>` tag for proper client-side tracking
- After all provider wrappers and UI components
- Follows Next.js App Router best practices for analytics integration

### Verification

✅ **Package Installation**: Successfully installed using pnpm
✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: Passes without errors related to Analytics
✅ **Linting**: No new linting errors or warnings introduced
✅ **Code Structure**: Preserves all existing functionality and component hierarchy
✅ **Build Process**: Analytics integration compiles successfully (build errors are unrelated to Analytics and due to missing DATABASE_URL environment variable for Prisma)

### Notes

- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and web vitals
- No additional configuration is needed for basic analytics tracking
- Analytics data will appear in the Vercel dashboard when deployed
- The implementation follows Vercel's official documentation for Next.js App Router projects
